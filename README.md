# Missing Error Handling in Express.js POST Request

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: the lack of proper error handling for requests with missing or invalid data.  The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.

## Problem

The original code lacks input validation. If a client sends a POST request to `/user` without a body or with an incomplete/invalid JSON body, the server will either log an error (if the missing field is accessed) or silently fail to create the user, leading to unexpected behavior.

## Solution

The solution involves adding comprehensive input validation to check if the required fields exist in the request body before processing them. Error handling mechanisms are also implemented to return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages to the client.
